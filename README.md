# Arcade Game Clone Project

## Project Overview

**Project acceptance date: 23 April 2018**

**[Live preview](http://annikaiser.com/arcade-game/)**

The task for this project was to recreate the famous "Frogger" arcade game using JavaScript. 
This game was built with [Udacity's](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) starter code, which included a game engine and the visual resources. I used vanilla JavaScript to build out the functionality. The game was designed to adhere to the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view).


## Game Description

The player must cross a dangerous grassy patch to get from one walkway to another. Bugs zoom across the grass to try and throw the player back to square one (originally, the board was set up so the player had to move from grass across stone and get to water to win - that set-up made little sense to me, so I shifted the canvas tiles around). The player uses the up, down, left and right keys to move. Reaching the top is a win, and the player is reset to the start to do it all over. It's like the worst nightmare you've ever had!

## Images

All image resources were provided in the starter project.

## To-Do

* Add WASD keys for left-handed players
* Add scoring functionality
* Add additional resources
* Add lives and a loss condition (e.g. after losing 3 lives, the player has to start from scratch)
